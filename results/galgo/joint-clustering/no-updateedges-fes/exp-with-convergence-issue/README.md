# Experiments for joint-clustering with a convergence issue
Author: Jorge Daniel Laborda
Date: 10th of January 2023

## Description
These experiments use the new parallelized pges that executes much faster and uses the new joint clustering. 
There is a **BUG** in the convergence. Most of the experiments don't converge right, they finish with 100 iterations.
